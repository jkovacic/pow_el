##About
This Modelica library contains several building blocks (e.g. switches, PWM generators, 
transistor gate drivers, etc.) that facilitate the design and modeling of SMPS (switching mode
power supply) based power electronics applications.

For more information see comments in components' source files and demo applications in 
the directory `/examples`.

##Prerequisites
* The [Modelica Standard Library 3.2.1](https://github.com/modelica/Modelica).
* [OpenModelica](https://www.openmodelica.org/) or 
[any other](https://www.modelica.org/tools/) Modelica simulation environment.

##TODO
The library is still a work in progress and is not complete yet. Several features will be
added as soon as possible, e.g.:
* Model of semiconductor diode reverse recovery losses
* Models of additional converters, e.g. flyback converter, forward converter,
various inverters, etc.
* PI(D) compensator elements for more sophisticated applications.
* Conversion of comments into standardized documentation annotations.
* Icons of library's components.
* Schematics of components' circuits.
* etc.
